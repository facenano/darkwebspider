# Overview

This is an open source, multi-threaded website crawler written in Python. There is still a lot of work to do, so feel free to help out with development.

Note: This is part of an open source search engine. The purpose of this tool is to gather links **only**. The analytics, data harvesting, and search algorithms are being created as separate programs.
